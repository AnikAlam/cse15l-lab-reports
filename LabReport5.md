# **Lab Report 4**

***
## Part 1 - Debugging Scenario 

1) Original student post showing symptom and describing a guess of the issue and failure inducing input
2) TA response asking another question/giving a suggestion for commands to try
3) Terminal screenshot/output of the information the student got from the TA suggestion; clear bug description
4) Include all the needed information: file directory/structure -> file content before fix -> command line cmd to trigger bug -> what to edit to fix the bug

## Part 2 - Reflection

Something that I've learned throughout the labs in the second half of the quarter was how to use and navigate VIM. Using it in tandem alongside the terminal commands we've learned has been very informative and interesting to learn about. I didn't particularly understand either of these subjects during the lectures, but once I was able to sit down and read the documentation for the commands and operations we learned, I gained a much better understanding. It also helped to engage with the material in the quizzes, labs, and skill demos because I personally find it much easier to retain information after applying it. On a similar note, the lab report where we were tasked with researching a specific command and some modifiers that can be used alongside it was another big topic of interest to learn and apply.
